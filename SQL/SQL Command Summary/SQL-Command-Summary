SELECT
  Select the column(data) in database
Syntax
  SELECT column, another_column, …
  FROM mytable;

    select Title from DataTable 

  SELECT  Title,Director
  FROM    DataTable
    select Tile and Director from DataTable

Select all data
Syntax
  SELECT  *
  FROM  mytable
Ex
  SELECT *
    FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
   WHERE year = 2012 AND year_rank <= 10
  
  select all data in tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end dataset that have year  = 2012 and year_rank <=10
  [select all data in tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end dataset when these 2 condition 
     have year  = 2012
     year_rank <=10
   are  true ]

Chain operation
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year = 2012
   AND year_rank <= 10
   AND "group_name" ILIKE '%feat%'
select all data in tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end dataset when these 3 condition 
   have year  = 2012
   year_rank <=10
   "group_name" ILIKE '%feat%'
      "group_name" 
          is a column name. The double quotes mean the column name is case-sensitive and this is common in PostgreSQL. 
       ILIKE 
          Means case-insensitive LIKE  Matches text without caring about uppercase or lowercase
            Example matches:
              Feat
              FEATfeature
              myFeatGroup
      '%feat%' 
         %= wildcard (matches any characters)
         'feat' = text to search for
      So:
        %feat% means:
          find text that contains “feat” anywhere beginning, middle, or end
 
  are  true
