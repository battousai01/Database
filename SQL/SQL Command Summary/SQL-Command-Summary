Chain operation
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year = 2012
   AND year_rank <= 10
   AND "group_name" ILIKE '%feat%'
select all data in tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end dataset when these 3 condition 
   have year  = 2012
   year_rank <=10
   "group_name" ILIKE '%feat%'
      "group_name" 
          is a column name. The double quotes mean the column name is case-sensitive and this is common in PostgreSQL. 
       ILIKE 
          Means case-insensitive LIKE  Matches text without caring about uppercase or lowercase
            Example matches:
              Feat
              FEATfeature
              myFeatGroup
      '%feat%' 
         %= wildcard (matches any characters)
         'feat' = text to search for
      So:
        %feat% means:
          find text that contains “feat” anywhere beginning, middle, or end
 
  are  true
